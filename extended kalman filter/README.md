This project explores extended kalman filter to fuse noisy information from GPS, gyroscope and lidar to track the true state (x, y, heading and forward velocity) of 2D vehicle. 

demo.py: used for testing different parameters of kalman filter 
sensor.py: define the properties of different sensors
vehicle2d.py: define the properties of 2d vehicle
sim.py: custom function for running simulation
util.py: provide custom tools
